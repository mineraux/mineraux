A student game I made in 2019 @Gobelins. We created a game about burn-out. The game gets more and more difficult through the time and you canâ€™t win at the end. We tried to create a feeling of stress so the user would feel like a real burn-out. Due to time restriction, we focused our work on the mobile version and make it playable offline (PWA)

**Rebelinna**

A student plateformer video game I made in 2020 @Gobelins. You play a princess in a silent kingdom (_like really, no sound at all_). Let's plug your headphones, and follow the music to reach the end of each level.

That's all for my personal or students projects. The last year, I passed my time working on private projects that I can't show here for legal reasons.

You can send me an email or DM me on my Twitter if you want more informations about that (with some legal limitations, face a judge is not in my projects).
